npm package management for Elixir — resolve, fetch, cache, and link npm packages from Mix without requiring Node.js for installation.

```sh
mix npm.install lodash
mix npm.exec eslint .
```

`npm_ex` reads `package.json`, resolves npm semver with PubGrub, writes `npm.lock`, and links packages into `node_modules/`.

## Why npm_ex

Elixir projects increasingly need JavaScript packages for assets, formatters, linters, browser libraries, and runtime integrations. npm_ex keeps that workflow inside Mix:

- no `npm install` step required for dependency resolution or linking
- reproducible installs through `npm.lock`
- global package cache in `~/.npm_ex/cache/`
- npm registry auth, mirrors, scoped registries, peer/deprecation warnings
- CI-friendly Mix tasks for install, verify, audit, outdated, tree, and exec

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:npm, "~> 0.7.0"}]
end
```

```sh
mix npm.init
mix npm.install lodash
```

## Common workflows

```sh
# Install and maintain dependencies
mix npm.install
mix npm.install lodash@^4.0
mix npm.install eslint --save-dev
mix npm.update
mix npm.remove lodash

# CI / reproducibility
mix npm.install --frozen
mix npm.ci
mix npm.verify

# Inspect dependency state
mix npm.list
mix npm.tree
mix npm.why accepts
mix npm.outdated

# Run scripts and binaries
mix npm.run build
mix npm.exec eslint .

# Registry, cache, and config
mix npm.info express
mix npm.search react
mix npm.cache status
mix npm.config
```

## How installs work

1. Read `package.json` dependencies, dev dependencies, optional dependencies, and overrides.
2. Resolve the full dependency tree using [hex_solver](https://hex.pm/packages/hex_solver) and [npm_semver](https://hex.pm/packages/npm_semver).
3. Fetch registry packuments and tarballs with integrity verification.
4. Store package contents in the global cache.
5. Link packages into `node_modules/` and write `npm.lock`.

`npm_ex` uses its own `npm.lock` because it is not npm. `package.json` remains the shared manifest; `npm.lock` records npm_ex's resolved dependency graph and security policy.

## Supply-chain safety

npm_ex is intentionally conservative around install-time code execution:

- package lifecycle hooks are **not executed automatically**
- packages declaring `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, or `prepare` are installed but reported as warnings
- tarball paths are validated before extraction to prevent cache escapes
- transitive git, URL, GitHub shorthand, and `file:` dependencies are blocked by default
- direct exotic dependencies require an explicit `exotic_deps` allowlist entry
- registry origins and redirects are policy checked
- newly created packages and freshly published versions can warn during install

This blocks common install-time credential stealers that rely on postinstall hooks reading files like `.env` and exfiltrating secrets during dependency installation.

## Auditing malicious packages

`mix npm.audit` supports npm vulnerability checks and OSV/OpenSSF malicious-package intelligence:

```sh
# npm registry vulnerability audit
mix npm.audit

# Strict online OSV malicious-package gate
mix npm.audit --osv

# Refresh the shared local malicious-package cache for the current lockfile
mix npm.audit --osv --write-cache --policy warn

# Deterministic offline gate using the shared cache or configured DB
mix npm.audit --compromised
```

`--write-cache` merges matching OSV advisories into `~/.npm_ex/security/compromised_packages.json` by default. `mix npm.audit --osv` fails closed when OSV cannot be queried; `mix npm.audit --compromised` is offline and deterministic.

OpenSSF/OSV is the default-compatible open data source. Socket, Snyk, and Phylum provide valuable proprietary intelligence or install-time firewall workflows; they fit best as external scanners/proxies or future optional integrations rather than default npm_ex install dependencies.

## Configuration

Most projects only need the defaults. Use `mix npm.config` to inspect effective settings.

Common environment variables:

- `NPM_REGISTRY`, `NPM_TOKEN`, `NPM_MIRROR`
- `NPM_EX_CACHE_DIR`, `NPM_INSTALL_DIR`
- `NPM_EX_BLOCK_EXOTIC_SUBDEPS`, `NPM_EX_EXOTIC_DEPS`
- `NPM_EX_ALLOWED_REGISTRIES`, `NPM_EX_ALLOW_REGISTRY_REDIRECTS`
- `NPM_EX_PACKAGE_AGE_WARNING_DAYS`, `NPM_EX_VERSION_AGE_WARNING_DAYS`
- `NPM_EX_COMPROMISED_DB_PATH`, `NPM_EX_COMPROMISED_POLICY`

Elixir application config is also supported:

```elixir
config :npm,
  registry: "https://registry.npmjs.org",
  token: System.get_env("NPM_TOKEN"),
  cache_dir: Path.expand("~/.npm_ex"),
  block_exotic_subdeps: true,
  exotic_deps: [],
  allowed_registries: ["https://registry.npmjs.org"],
  allow_registry_redirects: false,
  package_age_warning_days: 7,
  version_age_warning_days: 3,
  compromised_db_path: Path.expand("~/.npm_ex/security/compromised_packages.json"),
  compromised_policy: :error
```

## API organization

The main public API is `NPM`. Supporting modules are grouped by domain: `NPM.Package.*`, `NPM.Dependency.*`, `NPM.Lockfile.*`, `NPM.Security.*`, `NPM.Registry.*`, `NPM.Config.*`, `NPM.Install.*`, `NPM.Node.*`, `NPM.NodeModules.*`, and `NPM.Diagnostics.*`.

See `CHANGELOG.md` for the 0.7 migration map from older pre-namespace module names.

## Part of Elixir Volt

npm resolves, fetches, and links npm packages from Mix — no Node.js required for installation.

It is part of a frontend stack that runs inside the BEAM — builds, JS
runtimes, icons, and Vue-to-LiveView compilation as supervised parts of the
application instead of external toolchain processes. See the
[Elixir Volt](https://github.com/elixir-volt) organization for the rest, and
[Building Blocks for the Future Web](https://github.com/elixir-vibe/building-blocks)
for the thesis, architecture, and roadmap that tie them together.
